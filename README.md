# Carpool Web API

A carpool / ride-sharing REST API built with **ASP.NET Core (.NET 9)**, **EF Core (Code
First)** and **PostgreSQL**. Final academic project.

The central requirement is the **limited-resource booking**: seats on a ride are a scarce
resource protected by PostgreSQL-compatible **optimistic concurrency** (the `xmin` system
column), so two passengers can never both take the last seat and `AvailableSeats` can never
go negative.

## Architecture

Four projects, dependencies pointing inward only:

```
Carpool.API  ─►  Carpool.Service  ─►  Carpool.Core  ◄─  Carpool.Data
     └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        (API references Data only to register EF Core in Program.cs)
```

| Project | Responsibility | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Carpool.Core` | Entities, enums, DTOs, repository/service **interfaces**, domain exceptions, `JwtOptions`. **No EF Core, no ASP.NET.** | — |
| `Carpool.Data` | `CarpoolDbContext`, Fluent API configurations, migrations, seed data, repository **implementations**, `CarpoolUnitOfWork`. | Core |
| `Carpool.Service` | Business logic and validation, AutoMapper profiles, `AuthService` + `JwtTokenGenerator`, `RideStatusService`. | Core |
| `Carpool.API` | Controllers, exception/correlation middleware, JWT bearer pipeline, NLog, Swagger, the ride-status `BackgroundService`, DI wiring. | Core, Data, Service |
| `Carpool.Tests` | xUnit + Moq service unit tests and the two-`DbContext` concurrency test. | Core, Data, Service |

- Controllers never inject `DbContext`; they call services through interfaces.
- The Service layer never references EF Core — `IUnitOfWork` is the transaction boundary and
  the one place EF's `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is translated to a domain exception.
- All repository/service methods are `async` and flow a `CancellationToken` end to end.

---

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 9 SDK**
- **PostgreSQL 14+** running locally (default port `5432`)
- **EF Core CLI tools:** `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
  (or `dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef`)

---

## Configuration

No secrets are committed. Both values below live in **User Secrets** on the `Carpool.API`
project in Development, or as environment variables elsewhere.
`appsettings.json` holds only non-secret settings (issuer, audience, token lifetime,
background-service interval) with empty placeholders for the secrets.

### 1. Database connection string

```bash
cd Carpool.API
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:CarpoolDb" \
  "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=carpool;Username=postgres;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` (and `Username` if different) with your local PostgreSQL
credentials. The `carpool` database does not need to exist beforehand — EF creates it.
Outside Development, use the `ConnectionStrings__CarpoolDb` environment variable.

### 2. JWT signing key

```bash
cd Carpool.API
dotnet user-secrets set "Jwt:Key" "$(openssl rand -base64 64)"
```

(Any string of ~256 bits or more works; the app refuses to start if `Jwt:Key` is missing.)
Outside Development, use the `Jwt__Key` environment variable.

---

## Database — migrations

EF Core Code First, **three migrations**:

1. **`InitialSchema`** — all tables, keys, foreign keys, unique indexes (`User.Email`,
   `Vehicle.LicensePlate`, `Tag.Name`, `Rating(RideId, ReviewerId)`, filtered
   `Booking(RideId, PassengerId)` where `Status = 'Active'`), check constraints, the
   `RideTag` composite key, the `Ride` ↔ `Tag` many-to-many, and the PostgreSQL `xmin`
   optimistic-concurrency token on `Ride`.
2. **`SeedData`** — demo tags, users, vehicles and rides (see below).
3. **`AddTagOwnership`** — adds `Tag.OwnerId` (nullable FK to `User`) for the global/private
   tags extension (see *Tags — global + private* below); replaces the single unique index on
   `Tag.Name` with two filtered ones, scoped to global tags and to each owner's private set.

Apply them:

```bash
# from the solution root
dotnet ef database update --project Carpool.Data --startup-project Carpool.API
```

…or just run the API in Development — pending migrations are applied automatically on
startup (`Database.MigrateAsync()` in `Program.cs`, Development only).

Add a new migration:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project Carpool.Data --startup-project Carpool.API
```

---

## Running the API

```bash
dotnet run --project Carpool.API
```

Default URLs (see `Carpool.API/Properties/launchSettings.json`):
`https://localhost:7276` · `http://localhost:5096`

- **Swagger UI:** `https://localhost:7276/swagger` (Development only). Every endpoint is
  documented; use the **Authorize** button to paste a JWT and exercise the protected
  endpoints. A step-by-step manual test script is in
  [`docs/SWAGGER-WALKTHROUGH.md`](docs/SWAGGER-WALKTHROUGH.md).
- **Auth quick-start:** `POST /api/auth/register` → `POST /api/auth/login` → copy
  `accessToken` from the response → **Authorize** → `Bearer` is applied to every request.

---

## Seed / demo data

All demo users share the password **`Passw0rd!`** (demo only — not a real secret). The
stored value is a PBKDF2 / ASP.NET Core Identity V3 hash; plaintext is never stored or
logged.

| Email | Role | Vehicle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin@carpool.dev` | **Admin** | — |
| `alice@carpool.dev` | User | Toyota Corolla (`111-11-111`, 4 seats) |
| `bob@carpool.dev` | User | Honda Civic (`222-22-222`, 3 seats) |
| `carol@carpool.dev` | User | Mazda 3 (`333-33-333`, 5 seats) |

Seeded tags (global, available to everyone): `Quiet`, `Music`, `PetsAllowed`,
`SmokingForbidden`. See *Tags — global + private* below for how users can add their own.

Seeded rides (both `Scheduled`, departing 2030-01-01 so the background service leaves them
alone):

| Route | Driver | Seats | Price/seat | Tags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tel Aviv → Jerusalem | alice | 3 | 25.00 | Quiet, SmokingForbidden |
| Haifa → Tel Aviv | bob | 2 | 30.00 | Music |

**Role differences:** a normal user manages only their own vehicles, bookings and rides;
`Admin` can list all users, activate/deactivate accounts (`PATCH /api/users/{id}/status`),
and act on any vehicle/ride.

---

## Endpoints

| Area | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login` |
| Users | `GET /api/users/me`; `GET /api/users`, `PATCH /api/users/{id}/status` *(Admin)* |
| Vehicles | `POST /api/vehicles`, `GET /api/vehicles/my`, `GET /api/vehicles/{id}`, `PUT /api/vehicles/{id}`, `DELETE /api/vehicles/{id}` |
| Rides | `POST /api/rides`, `GET /api/rides` *(filter/sort/page)*, `GET /api/rides/{id}`, `PATCH /api/rides/{id}/cancel`, `PATCH /api/rides/{id}/complete` |
| Bookings | `POST /api/rides/{rideId}/bookings`, `GET /api/bookings/my`, `GET /api/bookings/{id}`, `PATCH /api/bookings/{id}/cancel` |
| Ratings | `POST /api/rides/{rideId}/ratings`, `GET /api/users/{userId}/ratings` |
| Tags | `GET /api/tags`, `POST /api/tags` |

Errors use one consistent body — `{ "statusCode", "message", "correlationId" }` — and map
expected business outcomes to `400 / 401 / 403 / 404 / 409` (never `500`).

## Tags — global + private

> This goes beyond the base assignment spec, which treats tags as predefined and read-only
> (see [`SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md`](SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md) → *Extensions beyond the base spec*). Added
> at the student's initiative as a deliberate enhancement.

`GET /api/tags` requires authentication (nothing else in this API is reachable
anonymously) and returns two kinds of tag:

- **Global** — the 4 seeded tags (`OwnerId` is `null`), visible to and usable by every user,
  exactly as the base spec describes.
- **Private** — created by a user for themselves via `POST /api/tags`, visible only in
  *their own* `GET /api/tags` response and only *they* can attach one to a new ride. Once
  attached, the tag's name is still shown to anyone viewing that ride.

Tag names are unique within their scope: once among the global tags, and independently once
per user's private set — two different users (or a user and the global list) may reuse the
same name without conflict.

---

## Ride status automation

A hosted `BackgroundService` reconciles ride status on a timer
(`RideStatusAutomation:IntervalSeconds` in `appsettings.json`, default 30 s, floor 5):

- `Scheduled → InProgress` when `DepartureTime` passes (sets `StartedAt`);
- `InProgress → Completed` when `DepartureTime + EstimatedDurationMinutes` passes (sets
  `CompletedAt`, and completes all of that ride's active bookings in the same transaction).

It opens a fresh DI scope per tick (`IServiceScopeFactory`) — it never holds a scoped
`DbContext`.

---

## Logging

**NLog** under the standard `ILogger<T>` (`nlog.config` in `Carpool.API`).

- Console + a daily rolling file: `Carpool.API/bin/.../logs/carpool-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
  (14-day retention). The `logs/` folder is git-ignored.
- Every request is logged once (method, path, status, duration, correlation id).
- Every request gets a correlation id (`X-Correlation-ID` — honoured from the request if
  present, otherwise generated, and echoed back on the response). It appears on every log
  line.
- Levels: `Debug` for our own diagnostics, `Information` for normal events, **`Warning` for
  handled conflicts** (the domain-exception mappings), `Error` for unexpected exceptions.
- Passwords, password hashes, tokens and request bodies are never logged.

---

## Tests

```bash
# unit tests only — no database needed
dotnet test Carpool.Tests --filter "Category!=Integration"

# everything, incl. the 2 concurrency tests (needs a local PostgreSQL)
dotnet test
```

**60 tests** — 58 service-layer unit tests (repositories mocked with Moq, real AutoMapper)
covering the spec §70 list (successful booking, insufficient seats, driver-books-own,
duplicate active booking, cancellations, ride completion, rating eligibility, vehicle
rules) + 2 integration tests for optimistic concurrency (spec §69): two `DbContext`
instances race on the same ride's seats → first save wins, second throws
`DbUpdateConcurrencyException`, which `CarpoolUnitOfWork` surfaces as
`ConcurrencyConflictException` (→ HTTP 409).

The concurrency tests use a throwaway `carpool_test` database (created/migrated/dropped by
a fixture; override with the `CARPOOL_TEST_DB` connection-string env var) and skip cleanly
if PostgreSQL is unavailable. Full per-test catalogue:
[`Carpool.Tests/TESTS.md`](Carpool.Tests/TESTS.md).

## Submitting to GitHub

The `.gitignore` already excludes `bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/`, `logs/`, `*.log`,
`appsettings.Development.json` and User Secrets — nothing secret is tracked.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Carpool Web API — server"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/<carpool-server>.git
git push -u origin main
```

The React client lives in its **own separate repository** (not part of this solution).
